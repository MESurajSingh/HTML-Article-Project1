            <p>
                In an interview with a Kannada weekly magazine, Neel said he took to filmmaking initially for the need
                of money, following which he completed a course in the same, eventually developing interest in it. After
                having completed the course, he decided to cast his brother-in-law and actor Srimurali in Aa Hudugi
                Neene, a screenplay that he had written during the time. After the latter expressed his concerns due to
                his inexperience, Neel changed his mind and began observing Srimurali's mannerisms over a period of
                time, and came up with the project Ugramm, an action film.[9] The film turned out to be a massive
                commercial success and emerged as one of the highest-grossing Kannada films of 2014.[10]

                Reports emerged in late 2014 and early 2015 of Neel having been signed to direct three films. The first
                is a sequel to Ugramm, entitled Ugramm Veeram, which would feature Srimurali reprise his role from
                Ugramm. His next film KGF which stands for Kolar Gold Fields presented Yash in the role of Rocky, an
                orphan who becomes a don. The sequel KGF: Chapter 2, was scheduled for a theatrical release on 16 July
                2021, but was delayed due to the second wave of the COVID pandemic in India.[11]

                On 2 December 2020, Hombale Films announced the film Salaar with Prabhas. The film's shoot began on 29
                January 2021. In May 2021, Mythri Movie Makers and N.T.R. Arts have announced a film in collaboration
                with Neel and Jr. NTR, for his 31st film.[12] The film is expected to begin its production in April
                2023.[13]
