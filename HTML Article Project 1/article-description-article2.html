                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <hr>
                Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in
                Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to
                Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920).[28][b] Modi's family belonged
                to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[29][30][31] which is categorised as an Other Backward
                Class by the Indian government.[31][32]

                Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief minister of
                Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw attention to his
                low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his father's tea shop on the Vadnagar
                railway station platform,[33] a description that the evidence of neighbours does not entirely
                corroborate.[34][35] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers
                described him as an average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in theatre.[36] Modi
                preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his
                political image.[37][38]

                    In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until
                    1977. During this period, known as "The Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and
                    opposition groups were banned.[76][77] Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok
                    Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly
                    afterwards, the RSS was banned.[78] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently
                    travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the
                    government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[79][80] Modi was also involved with
                    creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for
                    political refugees and activists.[81] During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh
                    Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[82][83] Among the
                    people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as
                    several other national political figures.[84] In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often
                    forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[85]

                    Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the
                    areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to
                    work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to
                    Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped
                    organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably;
                    Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[86][87] After L. K.
                    Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important
                    positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this
                    role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[88]
