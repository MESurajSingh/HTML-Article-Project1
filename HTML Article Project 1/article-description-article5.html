                    1950, founded the Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu was born in Skopje—at the time,

                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <hr>
                Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)[8][page needed] Bojaxhiu (Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə
                ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]—Anjezë is a cognate of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud" or "little flower" in
                Albanian. She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family[9][10][11] in Skopje, Ottoman
                Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia).[12][13] She was baptised in Skopje the day after her
                birth.[8] She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday".[12]

                She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).[14] Her father, who was involved
                in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.[12][c]
                He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day
                Albania).[15][16] Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova,[17] believed by her offspring to
                be Bishtazhin.[18]

                According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became fascinated
                by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that
                she should commit herself to religious life.[19] Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she
                prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages.[20]

                Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham,
                Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of
                instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India.[21] She saw neither her mother nor her sister again.[22]
                Her family lived in Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana.[23]

                <h3>Missionaries of Charity</h3>
                <hr>
                On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she
                travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to
                leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to
                break the faith."[35] Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had
                just become Mother Teresa".[36]

                She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[24] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a
                simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several
                months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the
                slums.[37][38] She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and
                hungry.[39] At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women,
                and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".[40]

                Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister.[41] Mother
                Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she begged
                for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of
                convent life during these early months:

                Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, I learned a good
                lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked
                till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home,
                food and health. Then, the comfort of Loreto [her former congregation] came to tempt me. "You have only
                to say the word and all that will be yours again", the Tempter kept on saying. ... Of free choice, my
                God, and out of love for you, I desire to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did
                not let a single tear come.[42]
