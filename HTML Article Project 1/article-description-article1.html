                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <hr>
                Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in New Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.[15] His father, Prem
                Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a homemaker.[16][17] He has an older
                brother, Vikash, and an older sister, Bhavna.[18]

                Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[19] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School.[16][20] In
                1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first
                intake.[19] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma[17] and also played matches at the Sumeet
                Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[19] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent
                in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[16][21] His family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when
                they moved to Gurgaon.[22]

                Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.

                <h3>Early international career</h3>
                <hr>
                In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions
                Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[43] So,
                his selection was called a "surprise call-up".[44] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice
                openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout
                the series.[45] He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was
                dismissed for 12.[46] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match.[46]

                After the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the
                injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September
                2008.[47]

                Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, returned to the national team replacing the
                injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[48] He batted at number 4
                for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh.[49] He found a place in
                the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27[50] and 54 in the first two ODIs
                before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury
                recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[51][52] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth
                ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the
                third wicket with Gambhir.[46][53] India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[46]

                Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010,[54] which enabled
                Kohli to play in each of India's five matches.[55] During this series he became only the third Indian
                batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday.[56] Kohli was much praised for his
                performances during the series[57][58][59] as the leading run scorer of the series with 275 runs from
                five innings at an average of 91.66.
